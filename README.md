# Enigma

Model of an Enigma machine, cryptography. My first ever programming project, experimenting with Python, object oriented programming, and GUI design using Tkinter. Fairly horrible code, but a great learning experience. Released under the MIT license.

### Usage
To play with the Enigma machine, run 
``` python3 enigmaGUIbetter.py```
